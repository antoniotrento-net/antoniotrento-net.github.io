The cookie is set when the ga.js library executes and there is no _utmb cookie in place. It has an expiration time of 30 minutes, therefore if a user is inactive for a period longer than this, a new cookie will be set when the library executes and the interaction will be recorded as a new session.\n            \n                \n                    \n                        {% include bloocks/icons/heroicons/solid/badge-check.html class=\"flex-shrink-0 h-6 w-6 pt-1 relative -ml-6 text-indigo-500\" %}\n                        __utmz\n                    \n                \n            \n            This cookie is used to determine the traffic source, medium, campaign name and campaign term which delivered the user to your website. It is created when the javaScript library executes and expires after 6 months. This helps Google collect the data which can then help them to determine which traffic sources assist conversions within the multi-channel section of Analytics.\n            \n                \n                    \n                        {% include bloocks/icons/heroicons/solid/badge-check.html class=\"flex-shrink-0 h-6 w-6 pt-1 relative -ml-6 text-indigo-500\" %}\n                        __utmc\n                    \n                \n            \n            This Cookie waits 30 minutes, and then it expires. You see, __utmc has no way of knowing when a user closes their browser or leaves a website, so it waits 30 minutes for another pageview to happen, and if it doesn’t, it expires. And is used to store information, such as what time your current visit occurred, whether you have been to the site before, and what site referred you to the web page.\n            From Stackoverflow: What does __utma mean?\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        {% include bloocks/icons/heroicons/solid/badge-check.html class=\"flex-shrink-0 h-6 w-6 pt-1 relative -ml-6 text-indigo-500\" %}\n                        __utmv\n                    \n                \n            \n            This cookie is used for storing visitor-level custom variable data. It is created when the _setCustomVar method is used with a visitor level custom variable. Like the _utma cookie, this cookie expires after 2 years and is reset each time the user visits your site before the expiration of the cookie.\n            Although each of these cookies has a set expiration time, each time the ga.js library is executed and the expiration time has not been met the cookie is updated, resetting the expiration date to its original value.\n            These cookies contain no personally identifiable information but they will use your computer’s IP address to know from where in the world you are accessing the Internet.\n            Google stores the information collected by these cookies on servers in the United States. Google may transfer this information to third-parties where required to do so by law, or where such third-parties process the information on Google’s behalf.\n\n        \n        \n        Opt-out\n        In order to provide website visitors with more choice on how data is collected by Google Analytics, Google has developed the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to stop data being sent to Google Analytics. The Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on does not affect usage of the website in any other way.

You wouldn’t dive into a debate with our ill-informed, weird uncle Gary just for the heck of it. And you definitely wouldn’t feed him. (We told you he was weird.) Downvote and flag comments instead. Although we can’t be everywhere at once, here are some of the kinds of comments we’re going to do our best to curtail: Promoting your own brand, product, or blog. So you’ve got a climate change solution that will simultaneously solve world poverty. Great. Send it through our contact form, you Elon Musk, you. Impersonating authors or other commenters. We can’t believe we have to say this, but: Don’t do that. It’s weird. Comments that make it clear you didn’t read the article. Enraged that we didn’t mention X in a story about Y? Slow down, Speedy McFingerson. If you’d made it past paragraph two, you’d see a very well thought-out discussion of that X you hold so dear. Comments that are completely out of left field. Sometimes discussions veer off a bit, but are still related to the original subject. That is fine. Hijacking the conversation to promote off-topic commentary is not. Threats — no matter how vague — against the author or other commenters. Things can get heated. Before you casually mention your foe’s home address, think of your Mother Earth. (Bonus points if you never use the phrase “Mother Earth.”) Racism, sexism, homophobia, you get the drift. Call us the PC Police, fine, but don’t say we didn’t warn you when you get tased. **And by tased, we mean banned or deleted. bloocks.dev has not — and will not — ever own a taser, and even if we were to own a solar-charged taser, we’d be too scared to use it. Trolling.

You wouldn’t dive into a debate with our ill-informed, weird uncle Gary just for the heck of it. And you definitely wouldn’t feed him. (We told you he was weird.) Downvote and flag comments instead. Although we can’t be everywhere at once, here are some of the kinds of comments we’re going to do our best to curtail: Promoting your own brand, product, or blog. So you’ve got a climate change solution that will simultaneously solve world poverty. Great. Send it through our contact form, you Elon Musk, you. Impersonating authors or other commenters. We can’t believe we have to say this, but: Don’t do that. It’s weird. Comments that make it clear you didn’t read the article. Enraged that we didn’t mention X in a story about Y? Slow down, Speedy McFingerson. If you’d made it past paragraph two, you’d see a very well thought-out discussion of that X you hold so dear. Comments that are completely out of left field. Sometimes discussions veer off a bit, but are still related to the original subject. That is fine. Hijacking the conversation to promote off-topic commentary is not. Threats — no matter how vague — against the author or other commenters. Things can get heated. Before you casually mention your foe’s home address, think of your Mother Earth. (Bonus points if you never use the phrase “Mother Earth.”) Racism, sexism, homophobia, you get the drift.

These may include the merchandise being in a certain condition (usually resellable if not defective), no more than a certain amount of time having passed since the purchase, and sometimes that identification be provided (though usually only if a receipt is not provided). In some cases, only exchanges or store credit are offered, again usually only without a receipt, or after an initial refund period has passed. Some retailers charge a restocking fee for non-defective returned merchandise, but typically only if the packaging has been opened.\n\n        While retailers are not usually required to accept returns, laws in many places require retailers to post their return policy in a place where it would be visible to the customer prior to purchase.\n\n        In certain countries, such as Australia, consumer rights dictate that under certain situations consumers have a right to demand a refund. These situations include sales that relied on false or misleading claims, defective goods, and undisclosed conditions of sale.\n\n        There are various reasons why customers may wish to return merchandise. These include a change of one's mind (buyer's remorse), quality of the merchandise, personal dissatisfaction, or a mistaken purchase of the wrong product. For clothing or other sized items, it may be a lack of a correct fit. Sometimes, there may be a product recall in which the manufacturer has requested (or been ordered) that the merchandise be brought back to the store. Also, gift receipts are offered sometimes when an item is purchased for another person, and the recipient can exchange this item for another item of comparable value, or for store credit, often on a gift card.\n\n        In certain countries, such as Australia, consumer rights dictate that under certain situations consumers have a right to demand a refund. These situations include sales that relied on false or misleading claims, defective goods, and undisclosed conditions of sale.\n\n        Source: Wikipedia\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            Disclosure Policy\n        I make money on this website through affiliate programs.
