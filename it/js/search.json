You see, __utmc has no way of knowing when a user closes their browser or leaves a website, so it waits 30 minutes for another pageview to happen, and if it doesn’t, it expires. And is used to store information, such as what time your current visit occurred, whether you have been to the site before, and what site referred you to the web page.\n            From Stackoverflow: What does __utma mean?\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        {% include bloocks/icons/heroicons/solid/badge-check.html class=\"flex-shrink-0 h-6 w-6 pt-1 relative -ml-6 text-indigo-500\" %}\n                        __utmv\n                    \n                \n            \n            This cookie is used for storing visitor-level custom variable data. It is created when the _setCustomVar method is used with a visitor level custom variable. Like the _utma cookie, this cookie expires after 2 years and is reset each time the user visits your site before the expiration of the cookie.\n            Although each of these cookies has a set expiration time, each time the ga.js library is executed and the expiration time has not been met the cookie is updated, resetting the expiration date to its original value.\n            These cookies contain no personally identifiable information but they will use your computer’s IP address to know from where in the world you are accessing the Internet.\n            Google stores the information collected by these cookies on servers in the United States.

The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to stop data being sent to Google Analytics.

These may include the merchandise being in a certain condition (usually resellable if not defective), no more than a certain amount of time having passed since the purchase, and sometimes that identification be provided (though usually only if a receipt is not provided). In some cases, only exchanges or store credit are offered, again usually only without a receipt, or after an initial refund period has passed. Some retailers charge a restocking fee for non-defective returned merchandise, but typically only if the packaging has been opened.\n\n        While retailers are not usually required to accept returns, laws in many places require retailers to post their return policy in a place where it would be visible to the customer prior to purchase.\n\n        In certain countries, such as Australia, consumer rights dictate that under certain situations consumers have a right to demand a refund. These situations include sales that relied on false or misleading claims, defective goods, and undisclosed conditions of sale.\n\n        There are various reasons why customers may wish to return merchandise. These include a change of one's mind (buyer's remorse), quality of the merchandise, personal dissatisfaction, or a mistaken purchase of the wrong product. For clothing or other sized items, it may be a lack of a correct fit. Sometimes, there may be a product recall in which the manufacturer has requested (or been ordered) that the merchandise be brought back to the store. Also, gift receipts are offered sometimes when an item is purchased for another person, and the recipient can exchange this item for another item of comparable value, or for store credit, often on a gift card.\n\n        In certain countries, such as Australia, consumer rights dictate that under certain situations consumers have a right to demand a refund. These situations include sales that relied on false or misleading claims, defective goods, and undisclosed conditions of sale.\n\n        Source: Wikipedia\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            Disclosure Policy\n        I make money on this website through affiliate programs.
